# [MO] Label tracking with Scrumble (~Xmin)

## Owner: Amaury Liet

## Intro

Scrumble offers you tools to have and share visibility about:
- the load of work left for a given track/label,
- the load of work already spent for a given track/label,

## Prerequisites (~1min)
- Go to scrumble and connect with Trello
- Open the `Labels Tracking` tab


## Steps

### 1. Select the Trello columns you want to consider (~1min)

For example the Done columns of the latest 3 sprints

### 2. Simply read the (approximate) complexity of each label

On our example, the `Usage` label represented a load of 37-38 complexity points on the sprints 19 to 21
